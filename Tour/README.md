# Introduction

This tour gives an overview of Hylo's features in the form of a progressive guide. It assumes familiarity with an imperative programming language such as JavaScript, Python, C or C++.

This tour does not cover the entire language. Please consult the [specification](https://github.com/hylo-lang/specification/blob/main/spec.md) for more detailed information.

Keep in mind that Hylo is under active development. Some of the features presented in this tour (and in the specification) may not be fully implemented yet or subject to change in the future.
